# Bones-Goldilocks
__A very light starter theme that uses The Goldilocks Approach__

Bones-Goldilocks takes [The Goldilocks Approach](http://goldilocksapproach.com/)
to responsive web design, integrated with best practices in web
typography into a stripped down version of the Bones theme for Wordpress.

This theme is intended to be used as a starter theme for bespoke Wordpress
theme development. Its features include semantic html5 markup, device-independent
responsive layout and a consistent vertical rhythm.

Issues and pull requests are most welcome.
